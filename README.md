# Lockeroom Frontend
Lockeroom frontend is designed to provide users with an intuitive, fast, and secure messaging solution. The application is built using React for dynamic user interfaces, Tailwind CSS for responsive and flexible design, and additional libraries like Tooltip and React Modal to enhance user interactions. It seamlessly integrates with the Lockeroom backend to offer real-time messaging and user management within a lobby system. Below is a detailed overview of the project and how to get started.

Project Overview
Lockeroom is a messaging platform focused on providing a unique and organized communication experience. It allows users to create and join lobbies, send messages in real-time, and manage users within lobbies. The frontend is optimized for performance, usability, and scalability.

Features
User Authentication: The platform provides a secure login and registration system, allowing users to access their accounts and manage their sessions.

Lobby Creation: Users can create and customize lobbies. Lobbies can be private or public, and they can set permissions for other users.

Messaging: Real-time messaging is enabled within each lobby, with options for direct messaging between users. All messages are delivered instantly, and the UI updates dynamically without the need for page refreshes.

User Management: Users can be added or removed from lobbies by admins, and user permissions within the lobbies can be easily managed.

Responsive Design: The frontend is fully responsive, offering a consistent experience across mobile devices, tablets, and desktops, with Tailwind CSS making it easy to adjust the layout based on screen size.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides an efficient way to render dynamic content and ensures the application updates only when necessary.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive, scalable, and customizable designs. Tailwindâ€™s flexibility allows for quick styling changes and ensures consistency across the application.

Tooltip: A small pop-up interface element used for showing additional information when hovering over certain UI elements.

React Modal: A library that provides modal windows for displaying content such as alerts, forms, or additional options, all while maintaining a clean user interface.
